#What's that Rockfish??#

I work at the [Aquarium of the Bay][http://aquariumofthebay.org/] and there are a ton of rockfish. Sometimes they're hard to tell apart, so I made a guessing game about it!

##TO DOs##
* Add messaging for 3 tries
* Add more rockfish
* Use an AJAX call to get info from Wikipedia
* Add autofocus on button once describ pops up
* Add point system


##Bugs##
* Mobile sizing and focus needs work
