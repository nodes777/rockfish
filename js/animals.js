       description : "Blue rockfish were once an important part of the California fishery; they were the most common rockfish marketed in San Francisco and San Diego during the 19th century, but have since declined in popularity. They continue to be of interest as game fish, and are among the most common types landed by boat anglers; in fact, there is evidence of overfishing in Monterey Bay and southern California"

        description: "Rockfish are slow-growing and extremely long-lived, and black rockfish become sexually mature only after 6 to 8 years of age. Specimen collected off Alaska have been aged to 49 years old."

        alts: ["Brown"],
        description: "The brown rockfish feeds primarily at night on small fishes, crab, shrimp, and other small invertebrates. During the day this fish tends to lie on the seabed among seaweed or next to rocks or in other hidden locations. Its spines are venomous and can cause painful injuries to the unwary."

        description:"The vermilion rockfish appears to mature and spawn for the first time at age 3–4. A vermilion rockfish that was 20 inches (51 cm) long was estimated to contain 282,000 eggs. By this measure a 30 inches (76 cm) female might hold as many as 500,000 eggs. The principal reproductive period is from December through March."

        alts: ["Canary"],
        description: "Young canaries live in relatively shallow water, moving to deeper water as they mature. Adults are mostly found at depths of 80–200 meters (with two recorded at 838 meters), tending to collect in groups around pinnacles and similar high-relief rock formations, especially where the current is strong. They may move considerable distances; one individual covered 700 km in four years after being tagged and released."

        description: 'Although Jordan and Evermann promoted the common name "yellowspotted rockfish", the "China" name has persisted, due to a perceived preference by persons of Chinese ancestry living in central California.'

        alts: ["Gopher"],
        description: "Gophers are extremely closely related to the black-and-yellow rockfish S. chrysomelas; S. chrysomelas is darker brown with yellow patches, and tends to prefer shallower water. While it was once thought that the black-and-yellow and gopher rockfish were merely color morphs of the same species, detailed genomic studies using microsatellite analysis have recently shown, however, that there is a significant amount of genetic difference between the two at loci that code for more than just coloration. This implies that they are indeed distinct, albeit closely related species, making them ideal specimens for studying sympatric evolution."

        alts: ["Kelp"],
        description : "This rockfish is an important prey item for many other animals. The larva is consumed by siphonophores and chaetognaths. The juvenile is food for other fish, such as lingcod, cabezon, and salmon, as well as many birds, pinnipeds, and porpoises. The adult is prey for sharks, dolphins, and seals. Additionally, this species is taken in spearfishing and angling."

National Marine Fisheries Service listed the Puget Sound/Georgia basin distinct population segment as endangered on April 28, 2010. Critical habitat was designated on November 13, 2014."
